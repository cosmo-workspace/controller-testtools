# chartsnap ðŸ“¸ã€€

Snapshot testing tool for Helm charts.

You can achieve powerful testing capabilities with minimal configuration within the `values.yaml` file. 

## Why Snapshot Testing? ðŸ“¸

We believe that snapshot testing, similar to the approach used in web testing with tools like Jest and vitest, is the optimal way to test Helm charts. Snapshot testing provides several benefits:

- **Visual comparisons:** Snapshot tests create a baseline output and then compare it to subsequent test results. This allows for easy visual inspection of changes and regressions in Helm chart rendering.

- **Enhanced maintainability:** Snapshot testing simplifies the test setup process, making it more accessible and maintainable, especially when dealing with complex Helm charts.

- **Easy updates:** When Helm charts change, you can update the snapshots if the changes are intended. This ensures that your tests adapt to the evolving Helm charts effortlessly.


## Features ðŸ”‘

* **Easy & Intuitive snapshotting for Helm developers**
  
  - **No tool-specific TestSuite file format**: Unlike some tools that require the creation of separate TestSuites with custom file formats, this tool doesn't require any additional file formats. Instead, you can prepare variations of the standard `values.yaml` file for each test case. This eliminates the need to learn new formats and simplifies testing.

* **Optimized for Helm chart**

  - **Handling dynamic output generated by helm functions**: You can specify additional properties within the values.yaml file for each test case to providing flexibility in adjusting test behavior. For example, you can control dynamically generated values generated helm functions like [randAlphaNum](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/).


## Motivation
A popular helm testing tool [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest) has already [snapshot testing feature](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest#snapshot-testing). While helm-unittest is a valuable tool for unit testing Helm charts, it has certain limitations for snapshot testing.

helm-unittest is designed that it conducts tests on a per-file basis within the Helm chart. This means that it evaluates each individual file independently, and when Helm chart values or conditions lead to an entire file being conditionally included or excluded, it can result in tests being unable to cover important scenarios.

> 
> ```yaml
> templates:
>   - templates/deployment.yaml
> tests:
>   - it: pod spec should match snapshot
>     asserts:
>       - matchSnapshot:
>           path: spec.template.spec
>   # or you can snapshot the whole manifest
>   - it: manifest should match snapshot
>     asserts:
>       - matchSnapshot: {}
> ```

For instance, consider a scenario where the Helm chart may create a `Certificate` resource of `cert-manager` when both TLS is enabled and cert-manager is enabled, but create a self-signed TLS `Secret` resource using helm function [`genSelfSignedCert`](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#genselfsignedcert) when cert-manager is not enabled. Furthermore, whether TLS is enabled or not affects Ingress's TLS properties, Deployment's app-specific TLS options, etc.

In such cases, helm-unittest may not be able to adequately test the entire chart's behavior, as the output of these conditional files may be empty, leading to incomplete tests.

Our motivation is to to offer a comprehensive and intuitive approach to conducting snapshot tests for Helm charts, Assessing the Helm chart as a whole, capturing the complete state of the rendered templates, including conditional logic, and enabling thorough testing, even when files are conditionally included or excluded based on Helm values.


## Installation ðŸš€

You can install as Helm plugin.

```sh
helm plugin install https://github.com/github.com/jlandowner/helm-chartsnap
```

Other options:

- Go install

  ```sh
  go install github.com/github.com/jlandowner/helm-chartsnap@latest
  ```

- [Download release binary](https://github.com/jlandowner/helm-chartsnap/releases)

## Usage

Just pass your chart for quickstart.

```
helm chartsnap -c YOUR_CHART
```

`__snapshot__` directory is created in the chart directory and `default.snap` is created.

Also you can create test cases as a variation of Values files of your chart.

Here is full usage of the command.

```sh
Usage:
  chartsnap [flags]

Examples:

  # Snapshot with defualt values:
  chartsnap -c YOUR_CHART
  
  # Update snapshot files:
  chartsnap -c YOUR_CHART -u

  # Snapshot with test case values:
  chartsnap -c YOUR_CHART -f YOUR_TEST_VALUES_FILE
  
  # Snapshot all test cases:
  chartsnap -c YOUR_CHART -f YOUR_TEST_VALUES_FILES_DIRECTOY
  
  # Set addtional args or flags for 'helm template' command:
  chartsnap -c YOUR_CHART -f YOUR_TEST_VALUES_FILE -- --skip-tests

Flags:
  -c, --chart string          path to the chart directory. this flag is passed to 'helm template RELEASE_NAME CHART --values VALUES' as 'CHART'
      --debug                 debug mode
      --helm-path string      path to the helm command (default "helm")
  -h, --help                  help for chartsnap
      --namespace string      namespace. this flag is passed to 'helm template RELEASE_NAME CHART --values VALUES --namespace NAMESPACE' as 'NAMESPACE' (default "testns")
      --release-name string   release name. this flag is passed to 'helm template RELEASE_NAME CHART --values VALUES' as 'RELEASE_NAME' (default "testrelease")
  -u, --update-snapshot       update snapshot mode
  -f, --values string         path to a test values file or directory. if directroy is set, all test files are tested. if empty, default values are used. this flag is passed to 'helm template RELEASE_NAME CHART --values VALUES' as 'VALUES'
  -v, --version               version for chartsnap

```

## Handling dynamic values ðŸ’ª

Values files can have a `testSpec` property that can detail or control the test case.

```yaml
testSpec:
  # desc is a description for the set of values
  desc: only required values and the rest is default
  # dynamicFields defines values that are dynamically generated by Helm function like 'randAlphaNum'
  # https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#randalphanum-randalpha-randnumeric-and-randascii
  # Replace outputs with fixed values to prevent unmatched outputs at each snapshot.
  dynamicFields:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      name: cosmo-auth-env
      jsonPath:
        - /data/COOKIE_HASHKEY
        - /data/COOKIE_BLOCKKEY
        - /data/COOKIE_HASHKEY
        - /data/COOKIE_SESSION_NAME

# Others can be any your chart value.
# ...
```
